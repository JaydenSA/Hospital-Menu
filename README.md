<h1>Project Title: Hospital Menu</h1> 

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>The application is designed to be used in a hospital to take orders from patients, those orders will be sent via email to the designated email address. The program will take infomation like Name, Patient Number, Allergens and the orders on offer.</p>

<h2>Motivations and Problems:</h2> 
<p>My wife is in the hospital at the time and, as I kept visiting and taking note of all the systems in place. I realised that the ordering system for the food was taken by the night shift the day before. The problem was that they kept getting things wrong or they couldn't give better details on the foods on the list.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2> 
<p>I used this as my first project back into programming in C++ since University back in 2017. Revising things like classes, objects, the different variable types and such.</p>
